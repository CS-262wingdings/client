 # PIGEON POLL
 
 ***For groups of 3 or more people who want to play something casual:***
 
 Using just one device,
 Pigeon Poll is a party game
 that is socially engaging, intuitive,
 and requires little setup.
 
As a player, you are tasked with gauging the opinion of your opponents using body language, inside knowledge, and reverse psychology. Do you know your friends better than they know themselves?

The game revolves around voting for questions posed by the first player. The last player tries to guess who voted for what answer. The questions can only be answered by naming someone in the group.
